# MIPS32-bit-Single_Cycle_Architecture_Implementation

# Description
Designed MIPS32(Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages)bit single cycle architecture.
Following things are required to get through this Project -:
       -Digital Logic Design
       -Computer Architecture (Basic)
       -Verilog HDL (Or VHDL , SYSTEM VERILOG)
       -Synthesis software(XILINX VIVADO OR Quartus intel prime lite(these both are free) )\
       -Simulation Tool(Xsim , Modelsim)
       
# ISA
  MIPS is basically the kind of RISC-philosphy , and have instructions particularly similar to RISC(Reduced instruction set architecture ) and acquired by MIPS technologies.
  In MIPS , there are basically three kind of instruction format.
  R-type , I-type , J-type .
  # R-type 

# Architecture
